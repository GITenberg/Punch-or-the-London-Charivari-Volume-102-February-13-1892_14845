    <h2>"PLEASING THE PIGS!" (From a Private and Confidential
    Report.)</h2>

    <p>Mr. CHAPLIN received a deputation on the subject of the
    Swine-fever last week. True to his dramatic instincts as
    regards the fitness of things, the Minister for Agriculture
    was, on this occasion, wearing a Sow-wester. He regretted that
    he was unable to don a pig-tail, which, as the representative
    of the Fine Old English Gentleman of years gone by, he should
    much like to do, but it was a fashion with the pig-wigs of the
    last century which he hoped to see revived as "a tail of old
    times." It was better, far better to be pig-tailed as were
    their great grandfathers, than to be pigheaded as were so many
    people with pig-culiar notions, specially in Scotland.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:60%;">
        <a href="images/73-1.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/73-1.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>"I am doing and have been doing," said the Ministering
    CHAPLIN, "my very best to please the pigs, but there are some
    pigs that won't be pleased when they find that everything is
    not going to be done for them gratis. You may take this for
    grunted,&mdash;I should say granted. Now let me give you an
    illustration. There were five pigs belonging to a well-known
    littery family. The first pig went to market but no one would
    purchase him, the second pig stayed at home (not feeling well),
    the third pig had pleuro-pneumonia, and the fourth pig was in
    full swing&mdash;if you can imagine a pig in a swing&mdash;of
    swine-fever; and the fifth and quite the smallest pig of the
    lot, a mere sucking-pig, went 'wheeze, wheeze, wheeze!' and
    'wheezes' were always a very bad sign. <i>À propos</i> of
    'signs' I have little doubt but that the well-known sign of the
    'Pig and Whistle' descends to us from ancient times of
    Influenza. He trusted that the whole pig-family would soon be
    pigging up again."</p>

    <p>The Right Hon. Gentleman finished by apologising for not
    being able to quote anything apposite from the works of either
    the philosophic BACON, the Ettrick Shepherd HOGG, or the poetic
    SUCKLING, his motto for the present being "<i>porker
    verba</i>," and he had to issue a Circular about the cattle who
    were all going wrong.</p>

    <p>The Deputation thanked Mr. CHAPLIN, and unanimously
    expressed their opinion, that where pigs were concerned, the
    Minister should have his stye-pend increased. Noticing that Mr.
    CHAPLIN had risen from his chair, and had assumed a threatening
    attitude, the Deputation hurriedly thanked the Minister of
    Agriculture, and speedily withdrew.</p>

            <p>Sturdy saint-militant, stout, genial soul,</p>

            <p>Through good and ill report you've reached the
            goal</p>

            <p>Of all brave effort, and attained that light</p>

            <p>Which makes our clearest noontide seem as night.</p>

            <p>How much 'twill show us all! We boast our
            clarity</p>

            <p>Of spiritual sense, but mutual charity</p>

            <p>Is still our nearest need when faith grows
            fierce</p>

            <p>And even hope earth's mists can hardly pierce.</p>

            <p>You were much loved; you spake a potent word</p>

            <p>In the world's ear, and listening thousands
            heard</p>

            <p>With joy that clear and confident appeal.</p>

            <p>The lingering doubts finer-strung spirits feel,</p>

            <p>The sensitive shrinkings from familiar touch</p>

            <p>Of the high mysteries, moved you not. Of such</p>

            <p>The great throng-stirrers! And you stirred the
            throng</p>

            <p>Who felt you honest and who knew you strong;</p>

            <p>Racy of homely earth, yet spirit-fired</p>

            <p>With all their higher moods felt, loved,
            desired.</p>

            <p>Puritan, yet of no ascetic strain</p>

            <p>Or arid straitness, freshening as the rain</p>

            <p>And healthy as the clod; a native force</p>

            <p>Incult yet quickening, cleaving its straight
            course</p>

            <p>Unchecked, unchastened, conquering to the end.</p>

            <p>Crudeness may chill, and confidence offend,</p>

            <p>But manhood, mother wit, and selfless zeal,</p>

            <p>Speech clear as light, and courage true as steel</p>

            <p>Must win the many. Honest soul and brave,</p>

    <p>"THIS INDENTURE WITNESSETH."&mdash;According to the
    <i>Times</i> of Friday last, February 5, Cardinal MANNING died
    practically a pauper. He had given everything away in charity.
    He was a "Prince of the Church," and his gifts to others were,
    indeed, princely. In the wills and deeds of how many of our
    Very Reverend and Right Reverend Lordships shall we find
    nothing gathered up and bequeathed of the loaves and fishes
    which have fallen to their share? Such a testament as the
    Cardinal's would be in quite a New Testamentary spirit.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>FOREIGN AND HOME NEWS.&mdash;"The Prussian Education Bill,"
    remarked an elderly bachelor to. Mr. PETER FAMILIAS, "is a very
    important matter; because you see&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Hang the Prussian Education Bill!" interrupted PETER F.,
    testily. "You should see the English Education Bill I've had
    for my boy's schooling last half!"</p>

    <h2>CONFESSIONS OF A DUFFER.</h2>

    <h3>IV.&mdash;THE DUFFER AS COLLECTOR.</h3>

    <p>I may be a Duffer, but I hope I am neither an idiot nor a
    cad. I have never collected postage-stamps, nor outraged common
    humanity by asking people to send me their autographs. With
    these exceptions I have failed as a collector of almost
    everything. To succeed you need luck, and a dash of
    unscrupulousness, and careful attention to details, and a
    sceptical habit of mind. Even as a small boy I used to waste my
    shillings at a funny little curiosity-shop, kept by a nice old
    lady who knew no more about her wares than I did. Here I
    acquired quite a series of old coppers, which Mrs. SOMERVILLE
    said were ancient Bactrian. We asked where Bactria was, and she
    replied that it was a "country beyond Cyrus." We answered that
    Cyrus was not a territorial but a personal name, "A fellow,
    don't you know, not a place," but the old lady's information
    stopped there. I wonder where my Bactrian Collection is now.
    Certainly I never sold it; indeed, I never sold anything; not
    only because nobody would buy, but because, after all, one is a
    Collector, not a tradesman. Birds' eggs I would have collected
    if I could, but you had first to find the bird's nest (almost
    an impossible quest for a born Duffer), and to blow the eggs,
    which, let me tell you, needs nicety of handling. I did once
    find a thrush's nest, and tried blowing an egg, but it was not
    wholly a success, and the egg (the contents of which I
    accidentally absorbed) was not wholly fresh. Then it is awkward
    when you are at the top of a tall tree, with an egg in your
    mouth, for safety, if the other boys make you laugh, as you try
    to come down. It is the egg which,&mdash;but enough! Everyone
    who has been in that position will understand what is meant. It
    is not difficult to collect shells on the seashore, but it is
    extremely difficult to find out what shells they are, after you
    have collected them.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:50%;">
        <a href="images/76.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/76.png"
             alt="'And, in shooting at the cats with a crossbow, I had the misfortune to break several windows.'" />
        </a>"And, in shooting at the cats with a crossbow, I had
        the misfortune to break several windows."
    </div>

    <p>Conchology is no child's play. As to collecting marine
    animals for an aquarium, the trouble begins when you forget
    your acquisitions, and carry them about for some time in the
    pockets of your jacket. That jacket is apt to be dusted by the
    bigger boys, who also interfere with your affections for toads,
    lizards, snakes and other live stock dear to youth. The common
    ambition of boyhood is to be a great rabbit-grower, but,
    somehow, my rabbits did not thrive. The cats got at them, and,
    in shooting at the cats with a crossbow, I had the misfortune
    to break several windows, and riddle a conservatory.</p>

    <p>The chief objects of my later ambition have been rare old
    books, gems, engravings, china, and so forth. All these things,
    if they are to be collected, demand that you shall have your
    wits about you; and the peculiarity of the Duffer is that his
    wits are always wool-gathering. A nice collection of wool they
    must have stored up somewhere. As to books, one invariably
    begins by collecting the wrong things. In novels and essays you
    read of "priceless Elzevirs," and "Aldines worth their weight
    in gold." Fired with hope, you hang about all the stalls, where
    you find myriads of Elzevirs, dumpy, dirty little tomes, in
    small illegible type, and legions of Aldines, books quite as
    dirty, if not so dumpy, and equally illegible, for they are
    printed in italics. You think you are in luck, invest largely,
    and begin to give yourself the airs of an amateur and a
    discoverer. Then comes somebody who knows about the matter in
    hand, and who tells you, with all the savage joy of a
    collector, that nobody wants any Elzevirs and Aldines, except a
    very few, and they must be in beautiful old bindings, uncut
    down, or scarcely cut down by the binder. These you may long
    for, but you certainly will never find them in the fourpenny
    box. The Duffer is always making the mistake of buying small
    bargains, as he thinks them, and so he will spend, in some
    time, perhaps, a hundred pounds. With a hundred pounds, and
    with luck, and prudence, and cunning, he might perhaps buy one
    small volume which a collector who knew his business would not
    wholly disdain. But, as it is, he has squandered his money, and
    has nothing to show for it but a heap of trash, of the wrong
    date, without the necessary misprints in the right places,
    ragged, short, and, above all, <i>imperfect</i>. I suppose I
    have the richest collection of imperfect books in the world.
    One hugs oneself on one's <i>Lucasta</i> (very rare), or one's
    Elzevir <i>Cæsar</i> of the right date, or one's first edition
    of MOLIÈRE, and then comes, with fiendish glee, the regular
    collector, and shows you that <i>Lucasta</i> has not the
    portrait of LOVELACE, that <i>Cæsar</i> has not his pagination
    all wrong (as he ought to have), that the Molières are Lyons
    piracies, that half of GILBERT's <i>Gentleman's Diversion</i>
    is not bound up with the rest, that, generally speaking, there
    are pages missing here and there all through your books, which
    you have never "collated," that "a ticket of PADELOUP, the
    binder, has been taken off some broken board of a book, and
    stuck on to a modern imitation, and so forth, all through the
    collection. You cannot sell it; nobody will take as a present
    this Library of a Gentleman who has given up collecting; even
    Free Libraries do not want this kind of treasure, and so it
    remains, littering your shelves, a monument of folly. Happy are
    the Duffers whose eyes are impenetrably sealed, and who can go
    on believing, in spite of a modern water-mark, in their sham
    BURNS MSS. and their volumes with autographs of all the
    celebrated characters in history. But my eyes are purged, and I
    do not think you shall find me collecting old books any more.
    Certainly I shall not venture into auction-rooms, compete with
    the Trade, and get left with a book artfully run up, thanks to
    my enthusiasm, to four or five times its market value.</p>

    <p>As to china, what the Duffer buys is invariably cracked, and
    the "marks" on which he places confidence are flagrant
    imitations. He usually begins by supposing that Crown Derby is
    a priceless possession, also he has a touching faith in chipped
    blue and white cups and saucers, marked with a crescent.
    Worcester they may be, but not the right sort of Worcester. And
    Crown Derby is the very Aldine or Elzevir of this market. You
    might as well collect shares in the Great Montezuma Gold Mine,
    and expect to derive benefit from the investment.</p>

    <p>Gems are among the things that the Duffer may most wisely
    collect, for the excellent reason that, in this country, he
    very seldom indeed finds any for sale. He cannot come to much
    sorrow, for lack of opportunities. In Italy it is different.
    How many beautiful works of Art I have acquired in Florence, at
    considerable ransoms, all of them signed in neat, but illegible
    Greek capitals. I puzzled over them with microscopes. The names
    seemed to end in &Iota;&Chi;&Lambda;&Eta;&Sigma;. I thought myself a
    rival of BLACAS, or Lord KILSYTH, or the British Museum. Then my
    friend, WILKINS, came in. "Pretty enough pastes of the last century
    I see," he remarks. "Pastes!&mdash;last century!" I indignantly
    exclaim; "why they're of the best period: Sards, all of them
    signed, but I can't make out the artist's name." "It is
    PICHLER," says WILKINS, "he usually signed, for fear his things
    should be sold as antiques." I had to give in about PICHLER
    (which certainly does not sound very Greek); "but here," I
    said, "you can't call <i>this</i> paste, you can't scratch the
    back of it." "I know I can't," says WILKINS, examining the
    ring, "for a very good reason, because a thin layer of sard has
    been inserted behind. But it's paste, for all that."</p>

    <p>"Well," I say, "here's a genuine ancient ring, old gold, and
    a lovely head of Prosperine in cornelian."</p>

    <p>"Well, this <i>is</i> odd," says WILKINS, "I know the
    setting is genuine, I have seen it before. But then it had a
    rubbishy late bit of work in it, and I was in the
    <i>atelier</i> when a gem-cutter shaved away the top of the
    stone, and copied your head of Prosperine on it from a Sicilian
    coin. I can show you a coin of the same stamp in my
    collection."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page78"

    <p>And he showed me it, otherwise I might have remained
    incredulous. "These scarabs," he went on, "are from Birmingham,
    I know the glaze. That gold Egyptian ring, Queen TAIA's do you
    say, is Coptic, Cairo is full of them. That head of CÆSAR is a
    copy from the one in the British Museum."</p>

    <p>"Why, it is rough with age," I said.</p>

    <p>"Ay, they've stuffed it down a turkey's crop, and it has got
    rubbed up in the gravel with which the ingenious bird assists
    the process of digestion. A <i>man</i> who could swallow that
    gem is a goose."</p>

    <p>I am presenting my esteemed collection of ancient engraved
    stones to my nephew at school, who shows all the character of
    the collector. He may swop them for bats, or tarts, or he may

    <h2>IN THIS STYLE, SIX-AND-EIGHTPENCE.</h2>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>Mr. Badgerer, Q.C.</i> (<i>rising to
        cross-examine</i>). Then you assert that the golden
        dinner-service which we are inquiring about was in your
        possession on the evening of July 26th at half-past eight
        o'clock?</p>

        <p><i>Plaintiff.</i> I do.</p>

        <p><i>Mr. Badgerer, Q.C.</i> And that when you went to take
        them out of the strong-box at 9:15 for your party they had
        disappeared?</p>

        <p><i>Plaintiff.</i> Quite so.</p>

        <p><i>Mr. Badgerer, Q.C.</i> Pardon my suggesting such a
        thing, but I am instructed to ask you whether, when you
        paid £800 to the rate-collector for arrears of rates on the
        very next day, you had not obtained that sum by selling a
        portion of this gold plate yourself?</p>

        <p><i>The Judge.</i> Really, Mr. BADGERER, this won't do at
        all. "Legal bullying" is a thing of the past, and I shall
        have to commit you for contempt if you make these unworthy
        suggestions to the Witness.</p>

        <p><i>Mr. Badgerer, Q.C.</i> But, m'Lud, the whole point of
        the defence is that the Plaintiff himself sto&mdash;</p>

        <p><i>The Judge</i> (<i>hastily interposing</i>).
        &mdash;Sh! You must not talk like that. Remember that "the
        floor of the Court is <i>not</i> the same thing as the
        interior of a coal-barge."</p>

        <p><i>Mr. Badgerer, Q.C.</i> (<i>sulkily</i>). Very well.
        But I really don't know how I am to conduct my case if your
        Ludship intervenes to check me. (<i>To</i> Witness.) I can
        ask you <i>this</i> at any rate. Did you or did you not run
        up to Town by an early train the morning after the
        robbery?</p>

        <p><i>Plaintiff.</i> Certainly I did. I went to see my
        tailor, in Bond Street.</p>

        <p><i>Mr. Badgerer, Q.C.</i> And why did you, then, go all
        the way from Bond Street to the City, eh?</p>

        <p><i>Plaintiff</i> (<i>gravelled</i>). My Lord, I must
        appeal for protection. The question is a bullying one.</p>

        <p><i>The Judge.</i> Oh, certainly! Counsel has no right to
        ask such things. He ought to take the charitable view of
        your actions, and suppose that you went to the City for a
        mid-day chop, or because you wanted to look at St. Paul's,
        or something of that kind. We must really try and conduct
        our business as nobly as we can.</p>

        <p><i>Mr. Badgerer, Q.C.</i> (<i>pleasantly</i>). "<i>Que
        Messieurs les assassins commencent!</i>" Then we will
        presume that your predilection for City chops is so great,
        that you went a couple of miles out of your way to get one,
        and that your reason for dropping in at the establishment
        of Messrs. BLANK, Goldsmiths, and offering them
        half-a-dozen dessert-plates&mdash;</p>

        <p><i>The Judge</i> (<i>interrupting</i>). Oh, really, this
        is not at all&mdash;</p>

        <p><i>Plaintiff.</i> Quite the reverse. I won't stay here
        to be insulted by anybody!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>Exit hurriedly.</i></p>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>Mr. Badgerer, Q.C.</i> I am afraid the Police
        Officers who are waiting outside to arrest our friend who
        has just left the box will also be denounced as "legal
        bullies." But after all one can't cross-examine a rogue on
        rosewater principles. And if we Barristers sometimes do
        make things rather rough for innocent Witnesses, by
        dragging out unpleasant incidents in their careers, or
        suggesting some that never occurred, by so acting we
        provide a powerful inducement to people to avoid having
        such unpleasant incidents to be dragged out. And if the
        fear of cross-examination prevents actions being brought,
        it thereby also prevents would-be litigants ruining
        themselves in law expenses. With submission, m'Lud, and if
        your Ludship pleases, I would say that we "legal bullies"
        are public benefactors in disguise.</p>

        <p><i>The Judge.</i> There's something in what you say, Mr.
        BADGERER. But the disguise need not be so complete as it
        is. I suppose it's a verdict for the Defendants?
        <i>With</i> costs, yes. Gentlemen of the Jury, I can't
        sufficiently express my sense of the nobility of your
        conduct in listening to the evidence as you have
        done&mdash;though, of course, if you had <i>not</i>
        listened, I should have committed you all for contempt in
        double-quick time&mdash;and you will now return a verdict
        for the Defendants.</p>

    <h3>MORE BONES TO PICK WITH THE SCHOOL BOARD.</h3>

    <p>We see there has been some churlish cavilling in some
    quarters because the School Management Committee of the London
    School Board passed a requisition in November last, sanctioning
    the purchase of an articulated skeleton for the Belleville Road
    School, at the very reasonable sum of £8 16<i>s.</i> Why make
    any bones about the matter? What more ornamental and indeed
    indispensable article of school-furniture than a human skeleton
    nearly six foot high? Still, should the past system of
    expenditure be continued in the future, <i>Mr. Punch</i> would
    suggest that excellent and infinitely cheaper substitutes for
    skeletons will be found in the persons of the rate-payers
    themselves.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>CUPID'S TENNIS-COURTS.&mdash;Under the heading "Tennis in
    the Riviera," the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> recently gave us some
    important news, which should largely influence the Matrimonial
    Market. The names of Ladies and Gentlemen, both "singles" (a
    not strictly grammatical plural, by the way, but what's grammar
    in a game of Thirty to Love?) were given. There was, however,
    no mention of "ties" or of matches to come.</p>

    'reminds one too much of AGAG.' Most cutting comparison for an
    actor sticking rigidly to the Shakspearian text! If there were
    interpolations in the text of Mr. BEERBOHM TREE's own
    introduction, then indeed he might remind them of <i>A-gag</i>;

    <p><i>House of Commons, Tuesday, February</i> 9.&mdash;House
    met to-day for what, the SAGE OF QUEEN ANNE'S GATE tells me,
    must needs be last Session of present Parliament. Appropriately
    funereal air over scene and proceedings. Usually Members return
    to work in highest spirits. Remember, in years gone by, before
    the blight of neglect in high places fell upon him, how dear
    old PETER RYLANDS enjoyed himself on these occasions. What long
    strides he used to take, bustling to and fro! What thunderous
    slaps of friendly welcome he bestowed on shrinking shoulders!
    What digs of deep and subtle humour he dealt to unresponsive
    ribs!</p>

    <p>If PETER were with us to-day, it is probable that even his
    effervescence of natural spirits would droop under prevalent
    gloom. The familiar place is a House of Mourning. Members tread
    softly, lest they should disturb the sick or wake the dead.
    Everyone has had the influenza, fears he is going to catch it,
    or mourns someone whom it has snatched away.</p>

    <p>When SPEAKER took Chair and business commenced, a glance
    round crowded benches brought back memory of much that has
    happened in the Recess.</p>

    <p>"'Tis not alone this inky cloak, good TOBY, worn in sign of
    public mourning," said WILFRID LAWSON, strangely subdued; "the
    House of Commons has had its losses."</p>

    <p>"Yes," I say, looking across at the Treasury Bench, where in
    the last weeks of July we were wont to see the kindly anxious
    face of OLD MORALITY, never more to cheer us with his little
    aphorisms, and incite to following his pathway of duty to his
    QUEEN and country. In his place, alert, youthful, strong, with
    ready smile breaking the unfamiliar gravity; of face and
    manner, sits the new Leader, still blushing under effect of
    ringing cheer that welcomed him to his high position.</p>

    <p>Lower down, filled up by another, is the place whence used
    frequently to arise a tall, almost gaunt, figure, which, with
    voice and manner indicating close associations with the Church
    pulpit, read from manuscript neatly-constructed answers
    designed to crush HENNIKER-HEATON. A kindly man and an able was
    RAIKES, who did not obtain full recognition for his
    administration of the office to which he was called.</p>

    <p>On the other side of the House a great gap is made by the
    withdrawal of PARNELL from the scene. A second, of quite other
    association, yawns where genial DICK POWER used to sit, and
    wonder what on earth he did in this galley, when he might have
    been riding to hounds in County Waterford. HARTINGTON gone,
    too, an unspeakable loss to gentlemen on the benches
    immediately behind. Many are the weary hours they have wiled
    away wondering whether, at the next backward jerk of the head
    of the sleeping statesman, his hat would tumble off, or whether
    catastrophe would be further postponed. In HARTINGTON's place
    sits CHAMBERLAIN, much too wide awake to afford opportunity for
    speculation on that or cognate circumstance.</p>

    <p>In his old corner-seat, in friendly contiguity, with his
    revered friend on the Treasury Bench, GRANDOLPH lounges
    contemplative. Met him earlier in afternoon. Passed us in
    corridor as I was talking to the MARKISS, who was anxious to
    know how the dinner went off last night, at which nephew ARTHUR
    appeared in character of the New Host at Downing Street. The
    MARKISS looked narrowly at GRANDOLPH as he passed with head
    hung down, tugging at his moustache.</p>

    <p>"You remember TOBY, what HEINE said of DE MUSSET? 'A young
    man with a great future&mdash;behind him.' There he goes."</p>

    <p>"Don't you believe it, my Lord," I said, with the frankness
    that endears me to the aristocracy. "You'll make a grave
    mistake if you act upon that view of GRANDOLPH's position."</p>

    <p>"Ah, well," said the MARKISS, a little hastily; "I must go
    and see STRATHEDEN AND CAMPBELL about this Portugal
    business."</p>

    <p>As he strode off I thought how precise and graphic remains
    Lord LYTTON's description of him, written before he came to the
    Premiership:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"The large slouching shoulder, as oppressed</p>

            <p class="i2">By the prone head, habitually stoops</p>

            <p>Above a world his contemplative gaze</p>

            <p class="i2">Peruses, finding little there to
            praise."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Sorry I vexed him.</p>

    <p>Some disappointment at GRANDOLPH's appearance. Hoped he
    might do honour to occasion by presenting himself in the attire
    clad in which he of late roamed through Mashonaland. It would
    have been much more picturesque than either of the uniforms in
    which mover and seconder of Address are obviously and
    uncomfortably sewn up preparatory to reciting the bald
    commonplace of their studiously conned lesson.</p>

    <p>"He might at least," said CHAPLIN, who, as Minister for
    Agriculture, takes an interest in specimens of animal produce,
    "have brought with him the skin of one of those nine lions he
    shot from the oak in which CHARLES THE FIRST took refuge."</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:30%;">
        <a href="images/84-2.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/84-2.png"
             alt="'No gun made would carry so far.'" /></a>"No gun
             made would carry so far."
    </div>

    <p>GRANDOLPH affects not to hear this whispered remark. It was
    addressed to NICHOLAS WOOD, who, leaning over back of Treasury
    Bench, laboriously explains that CHAPLIN is a little mixed;
    that the oak-tree to which he alludes was grown on English
    ground&mdash;wasn't it in Worcestershire?&mdash;and therefore
    could not afford a safe place of retreat whence lions might be
    potted in Central Africa.</p>

    <p>"There is," said NICHOLAS, emphatically, "no gun made that
    would carry so far."</p>

    <p>"Pish!" said CHAPLIN, somewhat inconsequentially.</p>

    <p>GRANDOLPH looks across at Front Opposition Bench, and
    wonders how Mr. G. is enjoying himself in the Sunny South.
    "Younger than any of 'em," GRANDOLPH admits. "Odd that with a
    general sweeping away of the Leaders in their places last
    Session, only he should be left. Expect he'll see us all
    out."</p>

    <p>"Order! order!"</p>

    <p>'Tis the voice of the SPEAKER. I thought he'd complain.</p>

    <p>"Notices of Motion!" he calls, in sonorous voice. Then the
    dreary business begins, MILMAN having all the fun to himself as
    he pulls a lucky number put of the Ballot Box, and Members rise
    in long succession, giving notice of interminable Bills and
    Motions, just as they did at the beginning of last Session,
    when HARTINGTON slept on the Front Opposition Bench, when OLD
    MORALITY fidgetted uneasily in the seat of Leader, and when
    PARNELL stood with his back to the wall in Committee Room No.
    15.</p>

    <p>TRULY AND REELLY.&mdash;Why didn't they at once elect
    COTTON, Alderman, Poet, and Haberdasher, for the office of City
    Chamberlain, without waiting for a show of hands and the rest
    of it? Of course COTTON ought to have been elected right off
    the reel.</p>

practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
